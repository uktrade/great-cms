            Which type of EORI number you need and where you get it from depends on where you're moving goods to and from. You may need more than one.

            If you do not have the right EORI number, you may have delays at customs and increased costs, for example your goods may have to be stored until you get an EORI.

            <p class="govuk-body govuk-!-margin-bottom-4">Rules of origin (ROO) determine the economic nationality of goods. They're used to judge how much of that product originated from a specific nation, and how much value was added to it during the manufacturing process.</p>

        <p class="govuk-body govuk-!-margin-bottom-4">
            The country of origin of a product can dictate how much duty is paid on it, and sometimes whether it can be exported to a particular country at all. By using ROO to accurately detail your product's origins, you could enable your importer to pay a lower tariff. For this to happen, you’ll need to demonstrate to the customs authority that you’ve met certain ROO requirements, as laid out in trade agreements.

We also know our product design is very appealing - and tastes as good as it looks.</p><p>We’ll be working with our existing marketing agency Blue Sky to run paid social campaigns to raise awareness of our product in Australia.</p><p>Our agency will also help with search engine optimisation so that Dove Gin appears in search results for craft gin in Australia. We’re very active on our brand social media accounts. We’re building up our connections with Australian influencers - bar owners, gin bloggers and premium gin importers. Once we have an Australian distributor,we’ll be able to leverage their promotional channels to reach a wider audience, for example liquor store email marketing campaigns.</p>'

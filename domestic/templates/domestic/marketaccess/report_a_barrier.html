                        A trade barrier is something that slows down, limits or prevents a UK business exporting to or investing in an overseas market.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        They can affect businesses of all sizes and at all stages of exporting, even if you’re just exploring opportunities.

                    <p>
                        Check if a trade barrier has already been reported on GOV.UK. The service will give you the trade barrier title and identifying code which can be used to report any issues with an existing barrier.

                        Trade barriers are tariff, non-tariff or overseas direct investment restrictions that block or delay investments, exports or potential to do business.
                    </p>
                    <p>You might be facing a barrier if, for example:</p>
                    <ul class="list list-bullet">
                        <li>regulations in an overseas market prevent you exporting or investing there</li>
                        <li>you supply services and have to pay unnecessary charges that give an advantage to domestic suppliers</li>
                        <li>your goods are delayed from getting to market by lengthy customs procedures</li>
                    </ul>

# Great Button

```<great-button>``` is a custom web component that extends HTMLElement it accepts all attributes that you would pass to a ```<button>``` plus the following custom ones:
- theme - one of the predefined themes ```primary```, ```secondary``` and ```tertiary```
- disable - when is set to any value it will render the button in a disabled state
- loading - when is set to any value it will show a loading spinner
- icon - shows an icon pre pended to the button's text

NOTE: Passing custom CSS class or inline style won't take effect as the button comes pre styled, to change the button appearance please pass ```theme``` attribute

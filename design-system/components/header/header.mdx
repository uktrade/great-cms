# Great Button

`<great-button>` is a custom web component that extends HTMLElement it accepts all attributes that you would pass to a `<button>` plus the following custom ones:

-   theme - one of the predefined themes `primary`, `secondary` and `tertiary`
-   disable - when is set to any value it will render the button in a disabled state
-   loading - when is set to any value it will show a loading spinner
-   icon - shows an icon pre pended to the button's text

NOTE: Passing custom CSS class or inline style won't take effect as the button comes pre styled, to change the button appearance please pass `theme` attribute
